# Part 2

## More common tags
1. There are a lot of useful tags for creating beautiul pages and I will be going over the very common ones that everybody use. The first one is `<h1>` tag. It's an header element and can go from `h1` to. The difference between `<h1>` and `<hearder>` is that `<header>` is for the document title and the metadata of the website while `<h1>` tag is used for like headings for an article. You can have up to `<h6>` and the size of the heading will be smaller accordingly.

1. Another one is the `<p>` which is paragraph element. It is a block element and can be used to design paragraphs.

1. The next one we have is `<div>` tag. It is known as division tag. It is used when you want to use different styles to differnet parts of your webpage. For example - if you have two paragraphs in your page, you can use div to style your first paragraph and second paragraph differently.

**Note**
You can also use in-line CSS to make different styles for above example without using `<div>` but using CSS will make your html file look more simple and clean. I will be going over CSS in the nexxt blog. 

1. `<br>` tag is simple. It is used to add a new line. 

1. `<ol>` and `<ul>`. They are _ordered List_ and _unordered List_. If you want to make a bullet list, you can use unordered list and if you want to list with numbers, you can use ordered list. You can also style your bullet points with `style="list-style-type:circle"` inside the `<ul>` tag. In order to create a list, you'll also have to include `<li>` together with these tags.

1. The `<hr>`, `<b>` and `<i>` are also used to make your page look pretty. Use `<hr>` to add a horizontal line, `<b>` to **bold** and `<i>` to _italicize_. 

1. The `<img>` tag is to add an image to your page. You can either add the link to an image or  path to the image you want to add from your files.

1. `<table>` is just like the name says - to create table. You will have to use it together with `<tr> - table row`, `<th> - table header` and `<td> - table element`. There are more but you don't have to worry about it for now. And you will also need to add style to your table to make borders visible because the default doesn't have any borders.
